# Gradient Descent Proof of Concept

Written by Miles Johnson

## Summary
This is a simple proof of concept of a Gradient Descent algorithm.  A global minimum is located at (-4, 6), and the program generates random starting coordinates with x and y values from -10 to 10.

To see the performance of the algorithm with different step sizes, change the "step\<n\> variable in line 32.
